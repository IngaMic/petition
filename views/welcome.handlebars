            <p>Did you know?

                Nearly 1 percent of passport applications in Germany last year were rejected for the reason that
                signatures
                did not meet the criteria for standard signatures. </br>
                At <strong>freeeyoursignatures</strong> we believe this simply cannot be allowed to continue.
                </br>
                The aim of this campaign is simple - we want people to be allowed to sign their passports and other
                legal documents any way they choose. Would you like your signature to be an adorable kitty, a dinosaur
                or a dragon,
                or a little caricature of you wearing your favourite glasses? You got it!
